	This vision asllows them to see everything including shadowhunters, vampire, werewolves, etc... The book consists of shadowhunter families attempting to stop all downworlders/werewolves and others from 
	breaking their code of law. The shadowhunters and downworlders coexist, but if any downwolrders or shadowhunters break their treaty then shadowhunters go out to kill them. The first book is about a rogue shadowhunter
	attempting to raise an ultimate race of shadowhunters.
